## Overview

Assist the production team from AutosRUs in reviewing production data for MechaCar. 


## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

* Vehicle_length and ground_clearance provde a non-random about of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. 

* The slope of this linear model is not considered to be zero. The multiple r-squared is 0.7149 and the p-value is below the signifance level of 0.05%. 

* This linear model does predict mpg of MechaCar prototpyes to be effective due to the r-squares value (0.7149) implying that about 71% of predictions will be correct.

* Lot 1 and Lot 2 meet the design specifications. The variance of suspension coild must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch, Lot 3 is at 170. 




## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

* The overall dataset has a p-value of 0.06 which is above significance level of 0.05 percent.

* Lot 3 is below the significance level of 0.05 percent with a p-value of 0.04 percent. 

* For lot 1 and lot 2 there is ot sufficent evidence to reject the null hypothesis and the two means are statistically similar. 




## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

With the fluctuation in gas prices consumers often consider MPG when looking to purchase a vehicle. 
The null hypothesis would be there is no statistical difference between average MPG for MechaCar and the competition.The alternative hypothesis would be 
there is a statistical difference between average MPG for MechaCar and the competition.We could use the T-Test for this to see where
we are compared to our competition, compare our city and highway fuel efficiency. Reviewing comparable models , including vehicle weight,vehicle 
length, engine cylinders and city/highway miles per gallon could be used to run the statistical test.
