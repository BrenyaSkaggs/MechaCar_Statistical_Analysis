* Vehicle_length and ground_clearance provde a non-random about of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. 

* The slope of this linear model is not considered to be zero. The multiple r-squared is 0.7149 and the p-value is below the signifance level of 0.05%. 

* This linear model does predict mpg of MechaCar prototpyes to be effective due to the r-squares value (0.7149) implying that about 71% of predictions will be correct.
